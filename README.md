Since 2016 I have been professionally building anything from web apps up to full cloud infrastructures for companies ranging from early stage startups to big corporations. I have adapted to different stacks over the years and ﬁnd joy in deeply researching them.

These are my key methods of leading successful projects:

* **Trunk‑based development:** Keep everyone working off `main`, guard it with CI and feature flags, and half‑finished features never block urgent bug fixes. Thin slices reach users early for real feedback.
* **Trust the tests:** Turn each escaped bug into a unit or E2E test. Reliability compounds release after release, while manual QA hunts in staging and production for fresh edge‑cases and lessons.
* **Automate everything:** Pipelines replace rituals, save time, and eliminate single‑person bottlenecks. A broken script beats a sick‑day outage every time.

If you need help with a project professionally or personally, please reach out. I'm happy to help.
